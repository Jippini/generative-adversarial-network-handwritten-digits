# generative-adversarial-network-handwritten-digits
A Jupyter Notebook implementing a generative adversarial network (GAN) in Tensorflow that learns to generate images similar to the MNSIT dataset.

To see final results of the GAN, read the conclusion in the GAN.html. 
Altenatively run the jupyter notebook (GAN.ipynb) e.g. with Anaconda.
